Script for Black Box Scanning

In this script, the user can define the target website and the list of functions that they want to scan for. The script then sends a GET request to the website and parses the response body as JSON. It then loops through the list of functions and checks if each function is present in the response body. If a function is found, it is printed to the screen.
